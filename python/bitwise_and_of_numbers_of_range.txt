            # We use the trick "right &= right - 1" to clear the least significant bit of 'right'
            # This effectively reduces 'right' each time, moving towards 'left'
            right &= right - 1
      
        # At the point where the while loop stops, 'left' and 'right' have the same prefix for 
        # their binary representations which is the answer to the problem.
